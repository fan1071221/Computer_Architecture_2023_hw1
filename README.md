# A Novel Approach to IP Routing: CLZ for Prefix Match

> Description: 
> In the current networking landscape, when multiple prefixes overlap, certain addresses might match with several prefixes. Given the 32-bit structure of IPv4 addresses, there's a potential for a vast array of prefix combinations in the routing tables. "Count Leading Zero" (CLZ) introduces a unique method, allowing for the calculation of consecutive zeros starting from the most significant bit of a binary number. My primary motivation is to explore how CLZ can be adeptly combined with other existing techniques to tackle the issue of overlapping prefixes in routing tables.

> Overlapping Prefixes in Routing Tables
>- **Issue**: Prefixes in the routing table can overlap.
>- **Implication**: Some addresses might match multiple prefixes.
